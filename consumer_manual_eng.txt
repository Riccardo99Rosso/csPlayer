Catcher-Consumer

Consumer Manual:
The patch takes care of playing, through a MIDI keyboard, the previously sampled sounds
with the Catcher.
After inserting a MIDI keyboard, choose the folder where the samples are located with "Choose the folder".
Set a time for the fade out (in milliseconds) and, if desired, record the result by choosing the folder first
where to save the file with "Choose the folder (for the record)" and then starting the recording with the appropriate button.
Have fun!
