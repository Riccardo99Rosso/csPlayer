Catcher-Consumer


Catcher Manual:

The patch samples sounds from a music track.
It is recommended to follow the following steps:
1)
Choose the piece to sample with "Choose track".
To control playback, use the computer keyboard, with the following commands:
s = start
e = stop
p = pause
c = continue
O = loop on
o = loop off
up arrow = increase volume
down arrow = lower volume
<number> right arrow = <number> / 100 track forward
<number> left arrow = <number> / 100 of track backward
Do not keep the arrows pressed if you want to repeat the operation several times but press them again.
2)
Choose where to save the samples with "Choose the folder" (it is recommended to choose an empty folder).
Set the fade in and fade out time (in milliseconds).
While the track is playing, use a previously attached MIDI keyboard to record the samples.
When a key is pressed, recording will begin, which will stop when the key is released.
To use samples recorded with the MIDI keyboard, use the Consumer patch.
